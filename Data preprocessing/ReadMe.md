Codes for CT data preprocessing
For fair comparison, isotropic resamplig is needed when CT images were obtained from various CT modalities.

CT images were .gz file format.





In the study, 6 datasets were used.
1. NSCLC-Radiogenomics
2. NSCLC-Radiomic-Genomics
3. CPTAC-LUAD
4. CPTAC-LSCC
5. TCGA-LUAD
6. TCGA-LUSC
